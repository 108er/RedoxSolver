# Redox Solver

A Python-based application for solving and analyzing redox reactions efficiently. The project is designed to handle complex chemical reactions, providing an easy way to balance redox reactions, calculate oxidation states, and more.

## Features

- Automatically balances redox reactions.
- Calculates oxidation states of elements.
- Supports a variety of chemical equations.
- Easy-to-read modular structure for maintainability and scalability.

## Project Structure

```
.
├── redox_solver.py    # Main application script
├── reaction.py        # Handles redox reaction logic
├── element.py         # Manages chemical elements and properties
├── utils.py           # Utility functions for parsing and validation
├── data.csv           # Dataset containing element data (e.g., atomic weights, oxidation states)
└── README.md          # Project documentation
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/108er/RedoxSolver.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd RedoxSolver
   ```
3. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

> **Note:** If `requirements.txt` does not yet exist, ensure you have Python 3.x and libraries like `pandas` installed, if working with `data.csv`.

## Usage

Run the main script to use the solver:
```bash
python redox_solver.py
```

You can also modify and extend the functionality by editing the respective modules. Below is an example of how to use the solver programmatically (for now this is the idea):

```python
from redox_solver import RedoxSolver

solver = RedoxSolver()
reaction = "MnO4- + Fe2+ -> Mn2+ + Fe3+"
balanced_reaction = solver.balance_reaction(reaction)
print("Balanced Reaction:", balanced_reaction)
```

## Contribution

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to improve the project, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/YourFeature`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add your feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/YourFeature`).
5. Create a pull request.
